  <Yokai_Wall.description>From wall to wall, the Hiirokane used to make this wall imbues it with spectral energy. The Nurikabe and its cousin share a sturdiness unmatched by anything on the Rim; that said, their durability comes from their magical nature: not just their physiology. Stories have spread far and wide about those walls, that they appear, suddenly, blocking a traveler's way, though such tales are often split upon whether the Nurikabe was invisible or not.</Yokai_Wall.description>
