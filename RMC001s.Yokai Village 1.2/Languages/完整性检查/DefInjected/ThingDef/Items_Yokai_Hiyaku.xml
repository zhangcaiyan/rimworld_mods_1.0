  <Yokai_Hiyaku.description>The Tuzurao are unmatched among the Yokai: their feet are unknown to the earth, for their steps bound across the field with the grace of wind; so fair and smooth is their skin, that any bullet or blow fails to find purchase, running across their skin like water; and their claws, what devices of man might equal their strength?
  \nThis pill, take it and inhabit their rage for a day; but, be prepared for the body to scream when such power leaves it.</Yokai_Hiyaku.description>
