  <Yokai_Reiyaku.description>This "miracle drug" comes in pill form, and is the result of mixing several Yokai products together. Tsuzurao magic is said to enable this pill's fantastical effects; however, even Yokai villagers ponder whether the blessing is placed on the pill, or is simply knowledge to make it in the first place.
    \nAs to its effects, this medicine heals any wound or defect over a very long time: this does not include limb growth, however. The regenerative effect can take anywhere from half a year to a year to occur; moreover, a dose must be taken every 5 days to maintain this process. The predominant side effect of this elixir is a mild penalty to conciousness.
    \nIn village and colony alike, children are known to complain about the terrible taste of this elixir.</Yokai_Reiyaku.description>
