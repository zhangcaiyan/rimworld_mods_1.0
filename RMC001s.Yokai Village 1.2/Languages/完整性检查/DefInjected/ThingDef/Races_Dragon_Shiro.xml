  <Yokai_Dragon_Shiro.description>The Shiro can be encountered anywhere from the Boreal Forest to Ice Sheet biome.
\n This white dragon enjoys eating grass, tree nuts, and fruit. Its intelligence is masked by humility; every season it gives its coat, willingly, to those that reside with it.
\n The dragon will also deign to fight beside you, though it may prefer the peace of caravan work.</Yokai_Dragon_Shiro.description>
