  <Yokai_HinoKo.description>This "Child of Fire," is a small unusual Yokai who-unironically-likes fire.
    \nAs seemingly living flames, they are resistant to heat and fire damage, and are mainly seen in deserts and extreme deserts.
    \nTheir fists are wrapped in flames, and their bodies explode upon death; thus, be careful when using them to defend your colony.
    \nThey are somewhat easy to tame. Butchering their smoldering corpses will render liquid fuel, not leather or meat.</Yokai_HinoKo.description>
