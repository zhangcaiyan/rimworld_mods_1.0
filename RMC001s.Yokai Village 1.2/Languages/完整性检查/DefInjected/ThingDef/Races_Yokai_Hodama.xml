  <Yokai_Hodama.label>Ho Dama</Yokai_Hodama.label>
  <Yokai_Hodama.description>A rare Yokai that can be found in any biome. Their widespread, infrequent nature has led to several beliefs concerning their existence; some people them to be the wandering spectres of dead relatives, while others see them as the chaotic embodiment of a forest fire. In few tales, however, are they known to actively harm others.
    \nTrees are their favorite snack, and a frequent one at that due to their small stomachs. Colonists should take caution when trying to handle them, as their attacks can set foes aflame.
    \nAs a ball of fire, cold is the only damage type they are vulnerable to. Slashing is somewhat effective, but blunt and heat have no effect.
    \nHunting these Yokai bears little reason, as their corpses will always fail to render leather or meat; morever, Ho Dama are known to explode upon death.</Yokai_Hodama.description>
