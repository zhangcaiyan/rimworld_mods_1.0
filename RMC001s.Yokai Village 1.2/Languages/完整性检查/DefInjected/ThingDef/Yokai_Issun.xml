  <Yokai_Issun.description>The Issun would be most accurately described as the "scouts" of any Yokai village. Their height is a meager 3 cm. This creature sacrifices strength and intelligence for great speed; moreover, their powerless state can easily be overcome by their large numbers. Due to their size, colonists have found it impossible to extract any usable meat or leather from Issun corpses.
    \nThe name "Issun" refers to the fairytale character Issun-boshi, whose name means "one-sun boy." (One sun is equal to 3 cm.) In Issun's tale he is the result of his parents prayers to have a child; however, Issun born only 3 cm tall and falls to grow with age. The story sees him become a warrior, defeat an oni, marry a wealthy official's daughter, and change to normal size via an Uchide no Kozuchi, or "tap-conjure hammer."</Yokai_Issun.description>
