  <FortuneCookie_Fox.label>Tsujiura</FortuneCookie_Fox.label>
  <FortuneCookie_Fox.description>A fortune cookie comprised of a rice cracker (Senbei) and a fortune (O-mikuji); however, this Tsujiura is missing its fortune, and instead houses a maiden's blessing of protection.
O-mikuji, which literally means, "sacred lot," is a strip of paper with a random fortune written on it. In another world, they are found in shrines and temples, who give them out as appreciation for small offerings.</FortuneCookie_Fox.description>

  <MysteriousWreath.label>Lefca's Wreath</MysteriousWreath.label>
  <MysteriousWreath.description>A wreath made of mysterious herbs and beautiful flowers. No one knows from whence the flowers came, or how the Lefca obtained by them; some have tried to follow a Lefca's every move, but the origin of these flowers has never been discovered.
The Lefca's Wreath is unfortunately too fragile to wear. Perhaps the herbs have some medicinal effect.</MysteriousWreath.description>

  <NutChocolate.label>Wolvern's Gift?</NutChocolate.label>
  <NutChocolate.description>"I'm giving you some because I made too much-it's NOT for you specifically! (baka...)" This heart-shaped chocolate with nuts was handed over to a colonist. It is oddly big for being an obligatory gift. The nuts-which appear to be from unknown tree-have been sprinkled throughout the chocolate, creating a marble-like pattern. 
When asked about the nuts she doesn't give a satisfying answer; she denies ever gathering them, and no one ever seems to know where they came from. This uncertainty often causes the receiving colonist to ask, "Is it really okay to eat...?" 
This "gift" can be received from a Wolvern once every couple of days.</NutChocolate.description>
