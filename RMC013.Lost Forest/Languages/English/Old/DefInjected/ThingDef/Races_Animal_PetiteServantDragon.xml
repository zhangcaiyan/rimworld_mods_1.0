  <LF_PetiteServantDragon.description>Legend tells that three of these dragons act as servants of the Dragonia: perhaps this is one of them? In any case, their kind-as a whole-has fallen from great esteem, as they were once the aides of the emperor in the old age, having served until the blue dragon was destroyed. Although many categorize them as the weakest of dragons, their sense of loyalty is unshakable. From dawn to dusk, they devote themselves to supporting the child of the blue dragon. Loneliness shall not find her, for they are ever with her. If these little ones are seen in the wild, then one may assume that they are looking for a Dragonia. They appear in all biomes with a very low probability.</LF_PetiteServantDragon.description>
