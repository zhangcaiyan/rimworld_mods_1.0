  <LF_Foxia.description>An elegant and exotic beastgirl. She has very fluffy ears, a large tail, and a strong immunity to most poisons and diseases, which surprises most given her frail appearance. Since the elder forest dwellers lost their leaders, Foxia have been relied on for their prophecies when deciding where the dwellers should move next. Yet due to their warm, dainty appearance, many have been caught by non-forest humans on this planet. Originally, they were a friendly race, but now they almost never appear to strangers. If you can see one, then you are very fortunate. They appear in all biomes with a very, very low probability.</LF_Foxia.description>
